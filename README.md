# Travel Itinerary Project

A web app to plan and manage your travel plans — built with React (Vite) on the frontend and Node.js + MongoDB on the backend.

---

## 📘 Overview

Users can:
- Add new trips with destination and dates
- View and manage existing trips
- Delete trips they no longer need

This project helped me practice connecting a React frontend to a Node + Express API and using MongoDB for storage.
